             Welcome to Koh Niann Tsyr's Portfolio! Here you will get to know more about me and the projects that I have done so far!

        <div id="Project">
        <h3>Project Repository</h3>
        <p2>3D printing: I have 3d printed name tags, drone components, flexi toys and many more. Below are suggested settings for PLA material</p2>
        <p2>It was important to ensure the first layer adhered well to the build plate as it is the foundation of the whole print</p2>
        <br><p2>Material: PLA</p7><br>
        <p3>Nozel temp: 210 degree celcius</p3><br>
        <p3>Print bed temp: 60 degree celcius</p3><br>
        <p3>print speed: 60 - 80mm/s</p3><br>
        <p3>support: off (for this print, support was not needed)</p3><br>
        <p3>adhesion: raft (not critical in this print)</p3> <br><br>

        <p4>Designing 2D/3D items: I have designed 3D and 2D items for my drones, for fun (name tags, name stands), and other customised</p4>
        <p4>items I can use using softwares such as Autocadd, Fusion360, and sketch up. I have used functions such as text, chamfer, fillet, extrude and many more.</p4><br>
        
        <br><br>
        <p5>Shirt Printing: I have customised my own shirt, using Canva and inkscape as my sketch platform and saved the file as png into a thumbdrive</p5>
        <p5>The method of printing used was dye sublimation, where the ink from the print is dyed on to each individual treade</p5>
        <p5>This is how heat sublimation printing work:<br>
        Set your heat press to 400 degrees. <br>
        Time: 45-60 seconds. Pressure: Medium.
        Place sheets of white copy paper or parchment paper inside your shirt to prevent bleed through.
        Position your transfer face down (use heat tape if desired) and cover with Teflon sheet.
        <br>Press.
        <br>Remove transfer immediately.</p5>

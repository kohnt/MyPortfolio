        <h1>3D printing:</h1>
        I have 3d printed gears, scaled down model, self-designed 3d models, joints, and many more. Prints originate from Thingivers, self-designed,
        and other online platforms where STL files are uploaded. It was important to ensure the first layer adhered well to the build plate as it is the foundation of the whole print.
        I have five 3D printers at home, which are used frequently for my business, 3D Kinetic which produces 3D printed custom name stands/tags and a wide variety of unique cookie cutters. 
        Below are suggested settings for PLA and TPU.<br> 
        
        <span style="background-color:#d4eeff">
        <br>Material: PLA<br>
        Nozel temp: 200-220&#x2103<br>
        Print bed temp: 60&#x2103<br>
        print speed: 50-80mm/s<br>
        </span>

        <span style="background-color:#d4eeff">
        <br>Material: TPU<br>
        Nozel temp: 200-230&#x2103<br>
        Print bed temp: 60&#x2103<br>
        print speed:10-20mm/s<br>
        </span>
        <br> Speed varies with setup (direct drive/bowden extrusion). Adhesion is not critical in most prints, however prints which have little surface contact
        to print bed should use raft for better base adhesion. Raft can also be used when printing gears as they help prevent elephant's foot.

        <h1>Designing 2D/3D items:</h1>
        I have designed 3D prints for my drones, for fun (name tags, name stands), and for my business.
        I have used multiple softwares such as SketchUp, Fusion360 and AutoCADD. Functions present are text, chamfer, fillet, extrude and many more.<br>
        Below are images of my 3D models before being printed.

        <h1>Shirt Printing:</h1>
        I have customised my own shirt, using Canva and inkscape as my sketch platform and saved the file as png into a thumbdrive
        The method of printing used was dye sublimation, where the ink from the print is dyed on to each individual treade
        This is how heat sublimation printing work:<br>
        Set your heat press to 400 degrees. <br>
        Time: 45-60 seconds. Pressure: Medium.
        Place sheets of white copy paper or parchment paper inside your shirt to prevent bleed through.
        Position your transfer face down (use heat tape if desired) and cover with Teflon sheet.
        <br>Press.
        <br>Remove transfer immediately.
